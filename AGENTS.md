## Mandatory Development Workflow for AI Agents

All AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Gemini, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Roo, Devin, etc.) MUST strictly adhere to the following workflow when working on this repository:

1. Issue-First Requirement: Never start writing code or creating pull requests without an existing GitHub Issue.
2. Issue Template: Issues must be created using the official Issue Forms (`01-bug-report.yml` for bugs or `02-enhancement-request.yml` for enhancements).
3. CodeRabbit AI Plan: Every issue must have a generated Coding Plan from CodeRabbit AI (`@coderabbitai plan`). AI agents must read and implement strictly according to the approved plan.
4. Branch Discipline: Always create and work on a dedicated branch (`feat/<issue-id>-<description>` or `fix/<issue-id>-<description>`). NEVER commit directly to `master`.
5. Documentation & Changelog: Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [Unreleased]` for any user-facing or architectural changes.
6. Local Verification: Run all test, lint, format, and typecheck commands locally before committing. All tests must pass with zero errors and zero warnings.
7. PR Template Completion: Always use `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. Complete all fields, link the issue using `Fixes #<id>` or `Closes #<id>`, and check all Pre-Submission Governance boxes with real terminal output.
8. Draft PR First: ALWAYS open pull requests as DRAFT (`gh pr create --draft`).
9. CI Verification: Wait for CI workflows to run on the draft PR and verify that all status checks pass.
10. Ready for Review: Only mark the PR as ready for review (`gh pr ready`) once all checks pass and all due diligence is verified.
11. Review Clearance: Review and resolve all CodeRabbit AI and GitHub Copilot comments. Ensure Codecov reports show zero errors, zero warnings, and no coverage drop.


## Executable Verification Commands

- `pytest` — Run unit and integration tests
- `ruff check .` — Run ruff linter
- `ruff format --check .` — Check code formatting
- `mypy custom_components` — Static type checking
- `pre-commit run --all-files` — Run all configured pre-commit hooks

## Boundaries and Safety Constraints

- Always: Write tests for any new or modified functionality, verify changes locally, and update CHANGELOG.md under `[Unreleased]`.
- Ask first: Major architectural changes, removing public APIs, or adding heavy external dependencies.
- Never: Commit secrets, credentials, API keys, or private certificates. Never commit directly to `master`.
